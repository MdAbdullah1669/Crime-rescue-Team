To fix the "Unknown column 'ca.details' in 'field list'" error:

1. Stop your server if it's running

2. Open phpMyAdmin (http://localhost/phpmyadmin) and select the 'crime_rescue_bd' database

3. Run this SQL query to add the missing 'details' column:
   ```sql
   ALTER TABLE `crime_alerts` 
   ADD COLUMN `details` LONGTEXT DEFAULT NULL AFTER `response_details`;
   
   UPDATE `crime_alerts` SET `details` = '{}' WHERE `details` IS NULL;
   ```

4. Alternatively, you can modify the crime_alerts table structure directly in phpMyAdmin:
   - Click on the "crime_alerts" table
   - Go to the "Structure" tab
   - Click "Add column"
   - Enter "details" as the Name
   - Select "LONGTEXT" as the Type
   - Set Default to "NULL"
   - Position: "After" "response_details"
   - Click "Save"

5. Then update all existing records to have empty JSON objects:
   - Go to the "SQL" tab
   - Run: `UPDATE crime_alerts SET details = '{}' WHERE details IS NULL;`

6. To fix the "Duplicate entry '0' for key 'PRIMARY'" error with crime_reports table:
   ```sql
   -- Delete any record with id=0 (if it exists)
   DELETE FROM crime_reports WHERE id = 0;
   
   -- Reset the AUTO_INCREMENT value
   ALTER TABLE crime_reports AUTO_INCREMENT = 4;
   ```

7. Restart your server
   
The errors should now be resolved.

Note: We've also modified the code in backend/models/crimeAlertModel.js to handle the case when the details column doesn't exist, but adding the column is the proper long-term fix.
